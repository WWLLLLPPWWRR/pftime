Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
You fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way

Tired of lying in the sunshine
Staying home to watch the rain
And you are young and life is long
And there is time to kill today

And you run, and you run to catch up with the Sun, but it's sinking
Racing around to come up behind you again
The Sun is the same in a relative way but you're older
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death
